Project Objective

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:

Proficiency in key Python data analytics libraries

Ability to combine, clean, process, and explore multiple datasets

Understanding of the data analytics lifecycle

Ability to communicate findings through narrative and visual analytics

Tools & Libraries Used

The analysis was developed using:

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

Project Workflow

The notebook follows a clear, iterative workflow:

1. Data Import & Combination

Multiple datasets are read into Python.

Datasets are merged into a unified analytical dataset.

2. Data Examination

Inspection of structure, data types, and preliminary issues.

Identification of missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.

3. Data Processing & Cleaning

Reshaping, filtering, and renaming columns.

Handling missing values (strategy described in notebook).

Fixing inconsistencies and removing or capping outliers.

4. Feature Engineering

Creation of at least two calculated fields, with a clear rationale.

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Includes:

Summary statistics

Distribution analyses

Correlation heatmaps

Bar charts, histograms, scatterplots

Additional visuals relevant to the dataset

Each visualization is explained with a rationale.

6. Findings & Insights

The notebook concludes with:

Patterns, trends, and relationships observed

Issues encountered and how they were addressed

Limitations, assumptions, and final insights
